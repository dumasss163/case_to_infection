## Non-China CDC source
There are date of CASE REPORT (confirmed, apparently)
The data file "extracted_from_ianmackay_plot.csv" was generated 
using a web plot digitiser at: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webplotdigitizer/blomnnpciekdhecimpnjfcchdicopdii?hl=en

Exact numbers were aligned with those shown in this plot: https://twitter.com/thelonevirologi/status/1222333249428623360

Where the delay between report dates on the x-axis could not be determined, I used the latest report date that it could be. 
This led to dates without report dates, and I therefore assumed that there were no updates in that time and carried
the case number from the previous report over.

The first plot cites Flutrackers.com, National Health Commission of the PRC, WHO and Wuhan Municipal Health Commission
The second plot cites WHO, Promed, China MOH and Flutrackers as sources.

## China CDC source
These are date of ILLNESS ONSET
The data files "china_cdc_suspected.csv" and "china_cdc_confirmed.csv" were generated using the same web plot digitiser.

Digitisation means that numbers near the start of the outbreak are fairly inaccurate.
